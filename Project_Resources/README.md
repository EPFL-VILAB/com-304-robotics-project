## `sim_ball_target.dae`

This file is an approximate model of the real world target that your robot will be required to navigate to. It can be used in simulation as a target to train your navigation policy with. If you find that the model is an inaccurate representation of your real target you may wish to modify the model, such as by changing the colour or using a 3D scan of the real target instead.
