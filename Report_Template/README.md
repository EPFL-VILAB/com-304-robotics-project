## Milestones

### Project proposal

For detailed instructions on what should be included in the project proposal see the [project guidelines](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qrfkgnbmmsdj#53611f). The proposal should be written with the latex template in the `latex-proposal-template` folder. Note that as stated in the project guidelines the proposal should be **at least one, and at most two pages long**.

### Progress Report

For detailed instructions on what should be included in the progress update see the [project guidelines](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qrfkgnbmmsdj#53611f). The progress update should be written with the latex template in the `latex-progress-update-template` folder. Note that as stated in the project guidelines the progress update should be **at most two pages long**.

### Final Report

## LaTeX Report Writing

### Latex

LaTeX is a typesetting system that can be used to produce text and image documents, similar to Google Docs, Microsoft Word or Pages. Unlike these, formatting is controlled with a markup system that allows for much greater fine-grained control of the layout of documents. As such, almost all academic papers are written with latex.

Your reports for this project should also be written in latex. We will provide you with a template that defines the general macro-level formatting and greatly simplifies preparing a document in latex. This is similar to the process of preparing a proper academic paper, as most conferences will provide a template to ensure standardization in terms of styling and content length over a given number of pages.

### Working with LaTeX

To work with latex you need to either install it directly i.e. from [the website](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) or use an online interpreter such as [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). We highly recommend using overleaf as it allows for easy collaboration when writing latex documents. Simply upload the files in the latex template folder to a blank overleaf project and recompile to generate a `.pdf` file from the latex markup code. You can then share the overleaf project and add other group members to jointly edit the document in real time, similar to google docs.
